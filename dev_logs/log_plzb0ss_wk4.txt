# Accomplished
- Provisioned AWS Cognito 
- Got together with Mike to assist with getting a test app working with AWS Cognito to request a JWT Token
- Researched ways to authenticate JWT Token in Backend 

# Difficulties
- Research took way too long everyone was using this JWT Authorization middleware it slighly differntly than me
- Eventually Mike came through with a way to expose the Token in the frontend so I could use it to help test
