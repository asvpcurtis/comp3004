# Accomplished
- Studied rules for how pairings are generated for knockout tournaments based off of seed how are remaining competitors paired
- Created functionality to support this nothing exposed to the front end yet
- Assisted with deliverable 2

# Difficulties
- Had to really flesh out how tournaments work in our application such that all tournament types would work
- Had to make the trade off not allowing user to know about who plays who until the round comes there would be a lot more work if exceptions have to be made for didferent tournament styles
