# Estimated time spent: 12h

# Accomplished
- Researched Frameworks for developing backend
    - Decided on using ASP.NET Web API Core 2.0 for The API framework
    - Decided on using Entity Framework middleware (an O/RM) to speed up development
- Familiarized myself with AWS
    - Provisioned AWS EC2 instance
    - Provisioned RDS with SQL Server Express

# Difficulties
- picking the right web framework for the backend was tough there was about 6 different versions of Web API making it hard to research the version you are interested in
