DEV LOG 4

-Familiarized myself with AWS Cognito and JWT tokens to understand how 
 user registration and store/retrieve process will be handled
-This week had 2 midterms and a 20-page paper, unfortunately not much 
 was done except understanding the theory of why AWS Cognito was chosen
 and learning how JWT tokens work and how they are handled
