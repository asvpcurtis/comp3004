# Estimated time spent: 10h

# Accomplished
- Got Authenication (JWT Token validation) working in the backend
- Got EntityFramework working
- Exposed REST endpoint /api/organizations to allow users to perform crud operations on their organizations

# Difficulties
- Took a very long time to figure out how to get my webserver to handle requests from everywhere
- probably any gap in my 2406 knowledge about ports and http protocols have been closed by now
